The project was centered around the use of Natural Language Processing techniques for gaining insights into the realm of mental health. 
Alarming statistics from the WHO revealed that 1 in every 8 people worldwide grapples with a mental disorder, often lacking access to effective care. 
The project aimed to shed light on the experiences of individuals dealing with common disorders through topic modeling and then help others facing a similar situation 
by providing them curated recommendations based on their disorder.

The approach involved web scraping data from the healthUnlocked platform, focusing on disorder-related concerns and recommendations. 
Leveraging text analytics, NLP, and LLM, the project crafted a Mental Health Recommendation System. This system not only showcased insights into the discussions
surrounding common disorders but also offered personalized advice derived from shared community experiences. The methodology encompassed topic modeling, 
word vector-based similarity analysis, sentiment analysis, and summarization. The project was a meaningful exploration of how data science can contribute 
to fostering a supportive and informed mental health community.
